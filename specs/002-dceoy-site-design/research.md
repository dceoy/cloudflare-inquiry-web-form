## Observations

- Single-column, text-first layout with a top-level title and section headings.
- Content is organized as short lists with nested bullets.
- Visual emphasis is created through typography and whitespace rather than graphic elements.
- No visible imagery or complex components on the landing page; presentation is minimal and informational.

## Design Implications

- Use a typography-first layout with clear hierarchy (title, subtitle, section labels).
- Keep components minimal, with thin borders, restrained colors, and generous spacing.
- Prefer list-like grouping for form guidance and helper text to mirror the site’s structure.

# Research: Modern, Dynamic Background

## Findings

- CSS-only approach is sufficient for layered gradients and soft shapes (radial/linear gradients, pseudo-elements).
- Subtle motion can be achieved with slow background-position shifts or transform-based floating shapes.
- `prefers-reduced-motion` should disable animations to meet accessibility expectations.

## Open Questions

- None. Visual direction is sufficiently specified for implementation within existing CSS.
